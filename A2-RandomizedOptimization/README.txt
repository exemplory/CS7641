CS 7641 - Machine Learning
Assignment 2 - Randomized Optimization
Student ID: vagrawal63

Steps to run my code:
1. All the code and data is available at a public Github repository hosted at: https://github.com/exemplory/CS7641/tree/master/A2-RandomizedOptimization
2. Download the data files: winequality.csv
3. The entire code is in JAVA and requires any JAVA IDE to run (I used Eclipse)
4. The easiest way to run the code is to download the repository and open the project in Eclipse (project settings are provided)
	- Run https://github.com/exemplory/CS7641/blob/master/A2-RandomizedOptimization/src/vagrawal63/a2/opt/Experiments.java to get the output of all the randomized algorithms
	- Run https://github.com/exemplory/CS7641/blob/master/A2-RandomizedOptimization/src/vagrawal63/a2/nn/WineNNRHC.java to find the NN weights for RHC
	- Run https://github.com/exemplory/CS7641/blob/master/A2-RandomizedOptimization/src/vagrawal63/a2/nn/WineNNSA.java to find the NN weights for SA
	- Run https://github.com/exemplory/CS7641/blob/master/A2-RandomizedOptimization/src/vagrawal63/a2/nn/WineNNGA.java to find the NN weights for GA
	- Run https://github.com/exemplory/CS7641/blob/master/A2-RandomizedOptimization/src/vagrawal63/a2/nn/WineNNFinal.java to find the results of the tunded NN
5. To create the charts, run the PlotCharts.py and PlotNNCharts.py in the Optimization folder (this is where trhe Java code will output the results of the algorithm runs) - https://github.com/exemplory/CS7641/tree/master/A2-RandomizedOptimization/Optimization
